# Changesets

Use Changesets to version and release public packages in this workspace.

- Create a release entry: `npm run changeset`
- Version packages: `npm run version-packages`
- Publish packages: `npm run release`

Automated release is handled by GitHub Actions via `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
