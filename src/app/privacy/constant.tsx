        Aero Exhaust seeks to protect the security of your personal information
        both online and offline. All credit card transactions are secure. Every
        on-line order is encrypted and sent through a secure server, using SSL
        technology to prevent information from being intercepted.
        <br /> <br />
        Confidential information such as your credit card number will be used
        only to fulfill your order. To protect your privacy, we will ask you to
        enter your credit card number and expiration date each time you place an
        order with us. This way, even if someone else accesses the account
        information stored on your computer, they won&apos;t be able to use your
        credit card.
        <br /> <br />
        E-mail is not encrypted and is not a secure means to transmit credit
        card numbers. We will only display the last 4 digits of your credit card
        number on your account.
