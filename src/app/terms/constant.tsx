        We may place a &quot;cookie&quot; on your computer&apos;s hard drive so we can
        recognize you as a return user and personalize your experience. A cookie
        is a piece of data that enables us to track and target your preferences.
        The cookie will be stored on your computer&apos;s hard drive until you remove
        it. We may also use temporary or &quot;session&quot; cookies to help you shop.
        These cookies will expire when you place an order. You can have your
        browser notify you of, or automatically reject, cookies. If you reject
        our cookies, you may still use the Site, but you may be limited in the
        use of some of the features. In addition, we may use IP addresses to
        analyze trends, administer the Site, track traffic patterns, and gather
        demographic information for aggregate use, as well as in combination
        with your personally identifiable information for credit fraud
        protection and risk reduction.<br /><br />
        Similarly, when you visit this Site or
        view one of our emails, we may use pixel tags (also called &quot;clear&quot;
        gifs), tracking links and/or similar technology to note some of the
        pages you visit on our Site and personalize your experience. We may also
        use pixel tags to determine what types of email your browser supports.
        We may use the information collected through pixel tags, tracking links
        and similar technology in combination with your personally identifiable
        information.<br /><br />
        www.aeroexhaust.com does recognize your ISP (internet
        service provider), however, we cannot identify you as an individual. If
        you make an on-line purchase we do collect information (such as sales
        statistics and traffic patterns) to help improve your shopping
        experience. We keep all information confidential.
